# SoundFieldsForever
## App Suite for Visualizing Sound in 3D

Authors: Scott H. Hawley (Unity & Javascript), Sebastian Alegre (all Android code)

This is really two different codebases for the same purpose.  One is an combination client-server system for Android [Tango](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tango_(platform)) Augmented Reality Devices, and another is a Unity app for use with HTC Vive Virtual Reality systems. 

This README is largely blank because the code development was put on pause after key students (Alegre & Yonker) were no longer available to work on the code, and Google dropped support for the Tango platform.
