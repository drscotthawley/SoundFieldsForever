<h2>Instructions for Using ParaView on Unstructured Data</h2>


First, <a href="https://www.paraview.org/download/">Download</a> and run ParaView.<br>
<br>
Then, import your data into a way that ParaView can use:
(<b>TODO:</b> investigate ParaView Templates so that all this is done automatically!)
<ol>
   <li>Select File &gt; Open &gt; (whatever your CSV file is), “Open”
   <li>On the far-left of the screen under the "Properties" tab (middle-height), click "Apply". This gives a spreadsheet View.  (Which we don't need, so click the "x" in the top-right of the Spreadsheet view to make it go away.)
   <li>In the upper left under "Pipeline Browser," click on the name of your CSV file.
   <li>Next you want to apply the "Table To Points" filter.  To do this, select Filters
     (at the very top menu bar) &gt; Alphabetical &gt; Table to Points.  (Or else do Filters > Search and type "Table to Points" and hit return)
   <li>On the left, change “X Column”, “Y Column”, “Z Column” to “x”, “y,” “z”.  Click "Apply".
   <li>(And if you want, go down to "Coloring" and change "Solid Color" to "dB")
   <li>In the upper left, if “eye icon” next to “TableToPoints1” is not colored (i.e. is greyed out), then click on it to show the points.  See the path of the Tango!
</ol>
Now you've got options...<br>
<br>
To make it look like our WebViz, you can do the following:
<ol>
   <li>Select Filters &gt; Alphabetical &gt; Delaunay2D, and click the eye next to the new object
   <li>Now in the bottom-left menu, scroll down to “Coloring”, and change it from “Solid Color” to “dB”
   <li>You can also recolor the path of the Tango from white to black by clicking on TableToPoints1 object, then above Coloring select “Point Gaussian”, and scrolling down, you can change the Gaussian Radius slider to something small.
</ol>
<b>3D Renderings</b>: Volume rendering, isosurfaces, etc.:<br>
<ol>
  <li>First turn your Points into a grid via 3D Delaunay triangulation: Click on your "TableToPoints1", then add the Delaunay3D filter.
    <li> Then you can Slice it or turn into Contours (aka Isosurfaces)...
     <li>Slicing is easy, just go up and click the Slice tool and click Apply, and move the slice around with the mouse.
    <li>For Contours/Isosurfaces, click the the Contour tool in the top left. Then scroll down and under "Value Range" click the little scale icon, between the minus and the red X.  Then click Apply.  Choose the colors as needed.
