# Visualizing Real-Time Point-Cloud Sound Intensity Data via Voronoi Tesselation

This is for the Google Tango app project, which uses a client-server model whereby the Tango ("client")
sends its measurements via WebSockets to this vizualization server.

Here's a prototype of our sound viz server.

You can pan and zoom. Yay!

This works best with the Chrome browser; Firefox is slow.


## Setup/Installation
Requirements: node.js


## To Run:

`node index.js`

You can test the server by running the Python (3) client:
`python3 test_client.py`
